      My name is **<u>Albert Zhao</u>**, and I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student at Boston University (Class of 2025), pursuing a major in <u>Computer Engineering</u> and a minor in <u>Business Administration</u>.

      I have always had a passion for using my skills and knowledge to contribute to something meaningfulâ€”something that will have a positive impact on my team, the company, or people around the world. I have been fortunate to work with amazing people, teams, and companies throughout my college career, which has allowed me to further develop my technical skills and interests while contributing to real projects.

      As my most recent internship concludes, I am seeking new opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute. I am open to opportunities in the fields of computer engineering and software engineering. See below for a quick overview of my skills and expertise.
